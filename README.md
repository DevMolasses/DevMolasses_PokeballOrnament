## Instructions ##
1. Print the following pieces (1 of each per ornament):
 * Top (Use red filament)
 * Middle (Use Black filament)
 * Button (Use White filament)
 * Bottom (Use White filament)
2. Remove all support material and sand parts to desired finish
 - Check fit regularly during sanding to ensure the parts go together properly
3. Cut a piece of red ribbon approximately 6-7 inches long
4. Tie the loose ends of the ribbon together to form a loop
5. Pull the ribbon through the hole on the Top piece until the knot gets stopped
 - **Be sure to pull the loop of ribbom from the inside to the outside so the knot gets trapped inside the ball**
6. Glue all the pieces together with your favorite ABS compatible adhesive
 - I used hot glue with acceptable results
